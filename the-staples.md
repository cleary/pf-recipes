**The Staples** are the ingredients from which we can (and frequently do) easily build a substantial meal for Pria. None of these are particularly unique or "specialty", and for the Long Shelf Life products you can quite easily purchase well in advance, and forget about.

Where there ia a brand preference or a flavour preference I've indicated it. Where there is a common ingredient for a product that Pria can't have, I've also indicated that so you can check ingredients before purchasing.
