Lentil Soup is a staple dish in our household. It's simple, hearty and delicious, 
and can be made as a thick bean dish, or as a more liquid-ey soup by varying the water amount

> * there's plenty of options for simple variations, add potatoes, carrot, or similar veggies that benefit from the slow cook
> * in it's thicker form, this makes a great side to a meat dish
