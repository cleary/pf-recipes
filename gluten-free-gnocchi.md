There's nothing much better than home made Gnocchi. This recipe makes a delicious, and authentic foundation for a pasta dish. 
There are plenty of options for sauces to use with this dish, I'll cover some of these in another post. 

In the meantime, please enjoy our variation on a great gnocchi recipe from the [italyonmymind blog](http://italyonmymind.com.au/potato-gnocchi-gluten-free/)!

Ingredients
===========
> * 2-3 large, similar size, unpeeled potatoes – about 750g
> * 1 cup plain gluten-free flour ([White Wings](http://www.whitewings.com.au/our-products/flour/gluten-free-plain-flour/))
> * 1 large egg-white
> * 1/2 teaspoon salt

Method
======
(Prep: 60-80 min, Cook 15-30 min)

> 1. Scrub the potatoes and place in a large saucepan, 3/4 filled with cold water
> 2. Bring to the boil and then simmer until the potatoes are tender. Start testing at 20 mins with a fork.
> 3. Drain, or remove one at a time if needed, and peel. 
> 4. Put the cooked potatoes through a mouli (or a grater will also work) and spread out in a large shallow bowl.
> 5. Make a well in the center of the potato and pour the egg-white into the center
> 6. Sprinkle the cup of plain flour and salt over the potato
> 7. Mix with your hands until the mixture is uniform and make a large loaf shape
> 8. Cut off a slice of the loaf and divide into cubes that are approximately 2 or 3 cm across
> 9. Roll each cube between the palms of both hands to form a small ball, then set aside and work on the rest of the potato loaf one slice at a time (covering the loaf with some plastic wrap to prevent it drying out). 
> 10. Cover the gnocchi you have rolled as you prepare them with a clean tea towel (again to prevent them from drying out).
> 11. Boil a large pot of salted water, and gently drop a handful of gnocchi in at a time (don’t overcrowd the pot)
> 12. Cook for a few minutes until they rise to the surface, test the consistency and continue cooking to taste if required
> 13. Lift the cooked gnocchi out of the water with a slotted spoon, and serve immediately!

Notes:
======
> * We found the uncooked Gnocchi lasted in a sealed, refrigerated container for 5-7 days
