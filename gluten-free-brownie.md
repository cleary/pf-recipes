Brownie is a classic recipe, and this one yields a decadent, dense and delicious treat - the way it should be! Gluten is not an essential component of any Brownie recipe so it's an easy one to modify. Having said that, when I began looking for "Gluten-free Brownie" recipes, I found a lot of ... "not so great" ones.

This particular Brownie method is based from a Nigella Lawson recipe - she knows decadent ;)
