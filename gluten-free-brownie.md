Brownie is a classic recipe, and this one yields a decadent, dense and delicious treat - the way it should be! Gluten is not an essential component of any Brownie recipe so it's an easy one to modify. Having said that, when I began looking for "Gluten-free Brownie" recipes, I found a lot of ... "not so great" ones.

This particular Brownie method is based from a Nigella Lawson recipe - she knows decadent ;)

Ingredients
===========
---
> * 225g Milk Chocolate Bits (*not* Dark Chocolate, it gives Pria migraines)
> * 225g Nuttelex
> * 200g Caster Sugar
> * 2 tbsp Vanilla Extract 
> * 3 Large Egg Whites (beaten)
> * 150g Almond Meal
> * 50g Self-Raising Gluten-free Flour
> * 50g Cocoa Powder

Method
======
(Prep: 15 min, Cook 45 min)

> 1. Preheat oven to 170 degrees (Celsius)
> 2. Melt the Chocolate bits and Nuttelex over low heat, in a heavy base saucepan
> 3. Take the pan off the heat, and stir in the Sugar and Vanilla - let it cool a little
> 4. Beat the egg whites into the pan, along with the ground almonds, flour and cocoa
> 5. Turn out into a lined 24cm square baking tin
> 6. Bake for 35-45  minutes. The top should set, but the middle should still be slightly gooey
> 7. Once cooled, cut into squares

Notes:
======
> * this keeps for 1 week in the fridge, or
> * 3 months in the freezer
